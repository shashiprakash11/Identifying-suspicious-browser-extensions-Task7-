## 🚫 Extensions Removed
1. **PDF Converter Pro**  
   - **Publisher/ID:** Unverified developer, random ID string.  
   - **Reason:** Excessive permissions, unnecessary (system already has PDF reader).  

2. **Shopping Assistant Lite**  
   - **Publisher/ID:** Unknown developer, poor rating on Chrome Web Store.  
   - **Reason:** Displayed product ads, slowed down browser, unnecessary.
