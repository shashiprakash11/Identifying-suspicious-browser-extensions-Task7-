# 📘 Step-by-Step Guide: Identifying & Removing Suspicious Browser Extensions  

This guide explains how to spot, review, and safely remove potentially harmful browser extensions.  

---

## 🎯 Objective  
- Detect unused, suspicious, or malicious extensions in browsers.  
- Remove them safely.  
- Document actions for accountability.  

---

## 🛠️ Tools Needed  
- **Google Chrome** or **Mozilla Firefox**  
- Internet access for checking extension reviews  
- (Optional) Antivirus/Malware Scanner for post-check  

---

## 🖥️ Steps to Follow  

### 1. Open Extensions Manager  
- **Chrome:** Type `chrome://extensions` in the address bar → Press Enter.  
- **Firefox:** Type `about:addons` in the address bar → Press Enter.  

---

### 2. Review Installed Extensions  
- Look at the **name, developer, and purpose** of each extension.  
- Ask yourself: *Do I remember installing this? Do I use it?*  

---

### 3. Check Permissions & Reviews  
- Click on **Details** for each extension.  
- Look for permissions such as:  
  - 🚩 *“Read and change all your data on the websites you visit”*  
  - 🚩 *“Read your browsing history”*  
- Open the extension’s Web Store / Add-ons page → check **reviews, ratings, and developer reputation**.  

---

### 4. Identify Suspicious Extensions  
Suspicious extensions usually have:  
- Unknown or shady developer name.  
- Low ratings / bad reviews.  
- Installed without your recall.  
- Permissions that don’t match their function (e.g., a calculator asking to read all browsing data).  

---

### 5. Disable & Remove  
- First **disable** the extension using the toggle.  
- Test browser performance for a few minutes.  
- If confirmed suspicious, click **Remove → Confirm**.  

---

### 6. Restart Browser & Verify  
- Restart your browser.  
- Check if performance improved (faster loading, no random ads/popups).  
- Verify **default search engine & homepage** are unchanged.  

---

### 7. Post-Removal Security Steps  
- Clear **cache and cookies**.  
- Run a **malware/antivirus scan** (Windows Defender, Malwarebytes, etc.).  
- Change passwords for sensitive accounts (especially if the extension had data access).  
- Enable **two-factor authentication** on important accounts.  

---

### 8. Document Your Findings  
Create a record (see `report.md`) with:  
- Extensions reviewed.  
- Suspicious ones found.  
- Actions taken (disabled/removed).  
- Post-removal checks done.  
- Screenshots saved for evidence.  

---

## 📌 Why This Matters  
- Malicious extensions can steal personal data, inject ads, or slow down your browser.  
- Regular audits of browser extensions improve both **security** and **performance**.  

---

## ✅ Deliverables for This Task  
- A filled `report.md` with suspicious extensions found (if any).  
- Screenshots before & after removal inside `screenshots/`.  
- This guide (`docs/guide.md`) for reference.
